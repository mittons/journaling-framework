# 📍 Ontological Anchor: Wake-Phase Framing

This document explains the logic behind using **Ontologic Onset Date** as the anchoring mechanism for journal entries.

---

## ⏱️ What is Ontologic Onset Date?

The **Ontologic Onset Date** refers to the date on which a conscious wake-phase begins — in other words, the date I wake up.  
It serves as the root marker for a given journal entry, regardless of how long that wake-phase extends into the next calendar day.

This model offers an internally coherent way to track personal activity that aligns with lived cognitive cycles, not imposed clocks.

## 💡 Why This Anchor?

- Traditional "daily logs" often split experiences across two dates (e.g., if you work late into the night).
- Ontologic anchoring captures the *integrity of the lived experience* by starting when consciousness resumes.
- This allows me to document not only actions, but transitions in awareness and cognitive mode.

## 🔁 Divergence → Convergence Framing

Each wake-phase is treated as a **cycle**:
- It begins with **Divergence** — the branching out of cognition, possibility, and exploration.
- It moves toward **Convergence** — organization, synthesis, rest, or reframing.
- Journals are tagged with the most fitting **cognitive mode**, and can evolve within a single entry.
