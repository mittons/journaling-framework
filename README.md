# 🧠 Journaling Framework — Divergence ↔ Convergence

A structured system for documenting wake-phase experiences using cognitive-mode tagging and personalized rhythms.  
This repository captures lived, shared, and symbolic processing across time — versioned with care.

> This is a self-reflective journaling structure designed to track wake-phase cycles anchored in personal rhythm and cognitive mode, rather than external clocks.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This journaling system is anchored not by the standard calendar day, but by *when a conscious wake phase begins*.  
Each entry reflects both the tangible tasks completed and the symbolic or cognitive state navigated.

The result is a system that respects real rhythms and promotes long-term interpretability — for myself, and potentially for others walking a parallel path.

## 📁 Structure

- `MonthlyJournals/`  
  Contains all journal entries, one file per month (e.g., `2025-07.md`).  
  Entries are appended in sequence and anchored by **Ontologic Onset Date** — the date I woke up.

- `docs/`  
  Symbolic models, framing logic, and interpretive guidance.  
  Includes the [`Activity-State-Model.md`](docs/Activity-State-Model.md) and [`Ontological-Anchor.md`](docs/Ontological-Anchor.md), with more to follow (e.g., epistemology, cognitive maps).



- `templates/` *(🗺️ Roadmap item)*  
  A planned folder for reusable log entry formats and framing elements.

## 🧭 Key Concepts

- **Ontologic Onset Date:** The date I *woke up* for a given wake phase. This serves as the anchor for journal entries.

- **Cognitive Mode Tags:** Each entry is labeled with a symbolic state such as `Divergence-Oriented`, `Oscillating`, `Convergent Reframing`, or `Edge`.  
  These tags come from a flexible model defined in [`docs/Activity-State-Model.md`](docs/Activity-State-Model.md).

- **Shared Experience Acknowledgment:** While this system documents personal states, many of the experiences it captures are shared — socially, structurally, and historically.  
  This framing avoids over-personalization of systemic patterns.

This project is now **at the activation threshold**. It began as a private seed and will be offered as a living structure — open to observation, reflection, or adaptation. The structure is evolving as clarity emerges.  
Future updates may include:
- An epistemic framing layer.
- Optional export tools for viewing or sharing entries.
